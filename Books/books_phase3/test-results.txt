"BooksDataSource Test Results, 17 April 2019"

Alex Battiste and Phuoc Huynh 

The other team: Matthew Stritzel and Alvin Bierley

The other team's code passed their own tests. 

At first, their code only passed 17 out of our 46 tests. This is because we had different interpretation of how the dictionaries stored the data. They stored all the numeric data as string type while we stored all of our numeric data as integers. THey also capitalized the first letter of their keys while we did not. 
Hence, we decided to change our test to fit their interpretation. Their code then passed 8 tests and gave 22 errors.
